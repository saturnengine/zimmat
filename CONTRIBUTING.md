## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository**

```sh
git clone git@github.com:saturnengine/zimmat.git
cd zimmat
```

2. Install Lefthook hooks

```sh
lefthook install
```

3. Run initial checks

```sh
lefthook run pre-commit
```

This runs all pre-commit hooks (formatting, static analysis, typo checks, etc.) on your code.

## üåø Contribution Workflow

To keep the project stable and organized, please follow these rules when contributing:

### 1. Do not commit directly to the main branch.

The `main` branch should always remain in a stable state.
**Direct commits to main are strictly prohibited. Always use feature branches and pull requests.**

### 2. Use feature branches and pull requests (PRs).

- Create a new branch for each feature, bugfix, or improvement:

```sh
git switch -c feature/my-feature
```

- Commit your changes to this branch.
- Open a pull request targeting `main` for review.

### 3. Code review and approval

- Every PR must be reviewed and approved before merging.
- Ensure all checks pass (lefthook hooks, tests, etc.) before requesting review.

### 4. Merge strategy

Use the "Squash and Merge" option on GitHub to keep the commit history clean.
